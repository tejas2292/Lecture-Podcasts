### Problem Statement : 
During the Covid 19 pandemic, all college courses are streamed live over the internet. Students do not have access to a well-organized platform for listening to recorded lectures. 
Considering mobile applications are extensively used and are known for their ease of use, they can be utilized efficiently for this job.

### Functionality & Concepts used :
The App has a very simple interface which helps the students to listen lectures. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

Linear Layout: It is a ViewGroup subclass, used to provide child View elements one by one either in a particular direction either horizontally or vertically based on the orientation property. We can specify the linear layout orientation using android:orientation attribute.

MediaPlayer: It is a class that is used to control the playback of audio/video files and streams.

ListView: It is a ViewGroup which is used to display the list of items in multiple rows and contains an adapter which automatically inserts the items into the list.

Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience TextView and interactive ImageButtons made it easier for students to access pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.

### Application Link & Future Scope :
You can access the app : [YOUR APP LINK HERE] (either Github link or Google Play store link of published app or .apk file).

We intend to make this app login-based in the future, so that teachers can upload their recordings without the need for administrative support.
