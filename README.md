# Lecture Podcasts

### Problem Statement : 
During the Covid 19 pandemic, all college courses are streamed live over the internet. Students do not have access to a well-organized platform for listening to recorded lectures. 
Considering mobile applications are extensively used and are known for their ease of use, they can be utilized efficiently for this job.

### Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a "Listening Podcasts, i.e. Lecture Recordings," in which faculty members would submit their recordings with the assistance of administration. The files are played using the media player, which has functions such as forward, backward, next, back, and hovering to any point of the recording. The project's scope is to extend it for other institutions and also to make it as no administrativeÂ support.

### Functionality & Concepts used :
The App has a very simple interface which helps the students to listen lectures. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :

Linear Layout: It is a ViewGroup subclass, used to provide child View elements one by one either in a particular direction either horizontally or vertically based on the orientation property. We can specify the linear layout orientation using android:orientation attribute.

MediaPlayer: It is a class that is used to control the playback of audio/video files and streams.

ListView: It is a ViewGroup which is used to display the list of items in multiple rows and contains an adapter which automatically inserts the items into the list.

Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience TextView and interactive ImageButtons made it easier for students to access pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.

We intend to make this app login-based in the future, so that teachers can upload their recordings without the need for administrative support.
